									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Much of the European eel’s life history was a mystery for centuries, as fishermen never caught anything they could identify as a young eel. Unlike many other migrating fish, eels begin their life cycle in the ocean and spend most of their lives in fresh inland water, or brackish coastal water, returning to the ocean to spawn and then die. In the early 1900s, Danish researcher Johannes Schmidt identified the Sargasso Sea as the most likely spawning grounds for European eels. The larvae (leptocephali) drift towards Europe in a 300-day migration. When approaching the European coast, the larvae metamorphose into a transparent larval stage called "glass eel", enter estuaries, and many start migrating upstream. After entering their continental habitat, the glass eels metamorphose into elvers, miniature versions of the adult eels. As the eel grows, it becomes known as a "yellow eel" due to the brownish-yellow color of their sides and belly. After 5–20 years in fresh or brackish water, the eels become sexually mature, their eyes grow larger, their flanks become silver, and their bellies white in color. In this stage, the eels are known as "silver eels", and they begin their migration back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn.<br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The European eel is a critically endangered species. Since the 1970s, the numbers of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by around 90% (possibly even 98%). Contributing factors include overfishing, parasites such as Anguillicola crassus, barriers to migration such as hydroelectric dams, and natural changes in the North Atlantic oscillation, Gulf Stream, and North Atlantic drift. Recent work suggests polychlorinated biphenyl pollution may be a factor in the decline.

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -The European eel breeds at sea, but migrates into rivers to grow before returning to the sea to spawn.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -The first three years of the European eel’s life are spent drifting in the ocean as a larva.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -It is thought that all European eels spawn in the Sargasso Sea, in the western Atlantic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -The European eel is very long-lived, potentially reaching an impressive 85 years old.<br>
