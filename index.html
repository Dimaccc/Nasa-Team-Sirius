									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every living thing needs energy in order to live. Every time animals do something (run, jump) they use energy to do so.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every animal plays a crucial part in the food chain which is why it’s very important to prevent the extinction of as many animals as possible. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Animals get energy from the food they eat, and all living things get energy from food. Plants use sunlight, water and nutrients to get energy (in a process called photosynthesis). Energy is necessary for living beings to grow.<br>
								</p>
								<p class="font">
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A food chain shows how each living thing gets food, and how nutrients and energy are passed from creature to creature. Food chains begin with plant-life, and end with animal-life. Some animals eat plants, some animals eat other animals.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A simple food chain:<br> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grass which is eaten by grasshopper which are eaten by mouse, the mouse are eaten by snake and snakes are eaten by hawk.<br>

</br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There is actually even more to this chain. After a hawk dies, fungi (like mushrooms) and other decomposers break down the dead hawk, and turn the remains of the hawk into nutrients, which are released into the soil. The nutrients (plus sun and water) then cause the grass to grow. It's a full circle of life and energy!!</br>

								</p>
								<p class="font">
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So food chains make a full circle, and energy is passed from plant to animal to animal to decomposer and back to plant! There can be many links in food chains but not TOO many. If there are too many links, then the animal at the end would not get enough energy.
