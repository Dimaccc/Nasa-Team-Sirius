									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is the smallest of the four species of vultures found in Europe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Egyptian Vulture is a globally endangered species included in the IUCN Red List as endangered. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The global population of the species is estimated to be between 21 000 – 67 000 individuals with a stable decreasing tendency.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Egyptian Vulture lives in open hills and low mountainsides. It nests mainly on rocks and cliffs, sometimes in the vicinity of human settlements.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The nest is positioned in niches, ledges and clefts and can be used for several years. The species is monogamous and in ancient Egypt it was regarded as the symbol of parental care.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Egyptian Vulture is a typical long-distance migrant. In September both juvenile and adult birds leave their nesting territories and start on a long journey back to their wintering grounds in Africa.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The species migrates in small groups mostly above land, avoiding the open sea. The birds fly over Turkey, then follow the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and enter Africa.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They concentrate in great numbers at places with plentiful food supply such as landfills and supplementary feeding sites along the migration route. <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In spring the Egyptian Vultures fly more than 4 000 km (2500 mi.) back to their homes over 30 – 40 days.
 This period is critical for the juvenile birds as they are still inexperienced flyers but have to overcome a number of threats along the way.
